# Java
## Various school projects, as well as projects I did myself to better understand Java and OOP principles.

### Notable mentions

__Airport Routes__
```
This particular program maps nodes, and deals with collisons. Displays the shortest path between nodes.
Nodes can be interchanged with 'airports'. The 'edges' is distance traveled between said airports.
More can be read in the project's _readme_.
