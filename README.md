On-going project I'm currently working on. The goal is to have clean, and concise code, and to have properly structure.
The plan is to further implement more advanced data structures and algorithms as the program evolves.

__Log_in__
```
A simple program to issue 'new employees' with an assigned email based on user's input prefix. Provided input will then
be appended with company email, and a random temporary password will be set. The user has options such as; Login, 
Recovery Email, Forgot Password, Set New Password, and display current information.
```
__textRPG__
```
Personal project of mine that I started after my first programming class at LSU. Although this program is relativey 
straight forward, and simple, it is my first solo project. The program is a fighting gauntlet where the user faces 
against random enemies, with controlled random stats. The user has commands such as;
Attack
Spells
Potion
Run.
User also levels up based on experience gained which improve their chances of getting a higher score. User score is 
kept and displayed if desired after game over, or user quits.
