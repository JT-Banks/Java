My take on a traditional Role Playing Game (RPG)
Will include various classes, armor, weapons, characters, towns, enemies, and abilities...

Structure:

     Object      
       |
       |
       |
    Creature   <-- parent
       |
       /\
      /  \
     /    \
    /      \
   |        |
Player   Monster <-- children
